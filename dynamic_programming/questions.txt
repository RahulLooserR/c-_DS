1. Knapsack problem (solve using recursion)
	capacity of bag is W,
	weight_of_item[] {1,2,4,5,9}
	value_of_item[]  {20,4,5,6,7}
	find maximum profit

2. solve above using memoisation and recursion
3. solve using memoisation and top down approach (no recursion, iterative solution)
4. subset sum problem: find if subset exists in array whose sum is equal to x.
5. equal sum partition: can array be divided into two partitions whose sums are equal
6. count subset whose sum is equal to x.
7. minimum subset difference
